### POLITICS

In the post-apocalyptic world of Veridia, the political landscape is fraught with intrigue and complexity as the Civilised Tribes vie for power and resources. At the macro level, the balance of tribes determines the overall stability and influence within the wasteland. At the micro level, individual leaders and power players within each tribe wield their influence, shaping alliances, rivalries, and the fate of Veridia itself.

**Macro-Level Political Intrigue:**
The macro-level politics revolve around a delicate balance of power among the major tribes. Each tribe controls a specific region rich in resources, and their ability to maintain and expand their territories is crucial for their survival. Trade agreements and alliances are brokered to ensure access to essential resources, making cooperation vital in the face of common threats such as monstrous creatures and raider factions.

Tribal leaders engage in strategic negotiations and diplomatic maneuvers to secure beneficial trade deals, establish non-aggression pacts, or forge alliances through marriage or shared interests. Tensions can escalate quickly, especially if two powerful tribes vie for control over the same critical resource. Territorial disputes, espionage, and sabotage add to the complexities of the political landscape.

**Micro-Level Political Intrigue:**
At the micro level, individual leaders and influential figures within each tribe play a critical role in shaping the tribe's direction and interactions with others. Leaders may have personal ambitions, conflicting ideologies, or long-standing grudges that drive their decisions. The quest for power, both within the tribe and in the broader political sphere, fuels intrigue and power struggles.

Within a tribe, trusted advisors, military commanders, and influential elders vie for the leader's favor and attempt to sway decisions to align with their own interests. Secret alliances and betrayals are common as individuals plot to advance their own standing or consolidate power.

Intrigue also emerges from external factors. Spy networks keep a close eye on rival tribes' activities, seeking to exploit weaknesses or gain valuable information. Disgruntled or disenfranchised members may defect to rival tribes or become double agents, sowing discord and chaos from within.

**The Fragile Balance:**
The very fabric of Veridia's society hangs on this intricate balance of power. An alliance shattered or an influential leader's sudden demise can send ripples of turmoil throughout the wasteland. Tribes may form temporary coalitions to topple a dominant power, while others may attempt to exploit internal strife to seize control.

Each tribe's actions have far-reaching consequences, affecting the lives of countless individuals. Factions might form and dissolve rapidly as new leaders emerge or challenges are overcome. Loyalties shift, secrets are traded, and the lines between friend and foe blur in this dangerous dance of power.

**Player Agency:**
As players step into the shoes of characters within the Civilised Tribes, they will be thrust into this political web of intrigue. Their actions and decisions will have ripple effects on the macro and micro political balance, potentially altering the course of Veridia's future. Players may choose to navigate the treacherous political landscape cautiously, forming strategic alliances, or they may be bold agents of change, disrupting the established order to achieve their goals. The fate of Veridia lies in their hands as they maneuver through the webs of power, loyalty, and deception, seeking to carve their place in this unforgiving world.

**GM Advice: Skill Relevance and Target Numbers**

As a Game Master (GM) in the world of Veridia, your role is to immerse players in a post-apocalyptic wasteland filled with challenges, dangers, and intriguing opportunities. One aspect of creating an engaging and dynamic experience for your players is considering the relevance of skills in different situations and adjusting target numbers accordingly.

In Veridia, characters possess a wide range of skills, from combat proficiency to diplomatic finesse and survival expertise. Each skill represents a unique area of expertise that can significantly impact the outcome of player actions. As the GM, you have the creative freedom to set target numbers for skill checks based on how relevant the skill is to the specific task at hand.

**Consider Skill Relevance:**

When players attempt a skill check, consider how closely the skill aligns with the task they want to accomplish. If the skill is highly relevant and directly applicable to the situation, you may set a lower target number. This signifies that their specialized training or expertise gives them a greater chance of success.

On the other hand, if the skill is less relevant or only tangentially related to the task, you can set a higher target number. This indicates that success might be more challenging to achieve, as their proficiency might not offer as much of an advantage.

**Encourage Creativity and Adaptation:**

As the GM, encourage players to think creatively and adapt their skills to various scenarios. Sometimes, a skill that may seem unconventional can still prove valuable in surprising ways. In such cases, consider lowering the target number to reward their innovative approaches and keep the game exciting.

**Dynamic Challenges and Narrative Impact:**

By adjusting target numbers based on skill relevance, you create a dynamic and immersive experience where players' choices and character abilities directly influence the outcome of their actions. This system allows for a more flexible and organic approach to challenges, ensuring that character skills play a significant role in shaping the narrative.

**Collaborative Storytelling:**

Remember that Veridia is a collaborative storytelling experience, and the interactions between players and the world you create together form the heart of the game. By tailoring target numbers to skill relevance, you empower players to be active participants in the unfolding story, leading to memorable moments and thrilling adventures.

As you guide your players through the wasteland, striking a balance between skill relevance and target numbers will add depth and realism to their journey. It will also keep them engaged and invested in their characters' growth and development, making Veridia an unforgettable post-apocalyptic saga.

**GM Advice: The Allure of Fanciful Names and Unexpected Discoveries**

In the world of Veridia, where the remnants of a once-thriving civilization blend with the mystical and unknown, fanciful names can evoke a sense of wonder and intrigue. As a Game Master (GM), you have the power to spark your players' imaginations with tales of ancient relics, hidden enclaves, and mysterious landmarks, each adorned with captivating names that pique their curiosity. The Crystal Nexus, the Evergreen Enclave, the Luminous Lodge — these names carry an air of mystery, promising secrets to be unraveled and treasures to be unearthed.

However, as your players venture deeper into the wasteland and explore these fabled locations, consider the allure of presenting them with unexpected discoveries that subvert their expectations. Behind the façade of fantastical names, lay surprising truths that reveal the remnants of a bygone era, blending the mundane with the extraordinary.

For example, the Crystal Nexus might initially be described as a place of otherworldly energy and radiant crystals, drawing characters in with visions of a mystical power source. But as they venture closer, the revelation dawns that the Crystal Nexus is, in fact, the remains of an auto-sustaining nuclear power plant, a marvel of pre-apocalyptic engineering that had once harnessed the atom's power to fuel the mega cities.

Such discoveries add layers of depth to your world-building and storytelling, blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. The contrast between the enchanting names and the ordinary origins of these places can challenge your players' assumptions, encouraging them to question what they know and to delve deeper into the history and mysteries of Veridia.

Additionally, these unexpected revelations can prompt role-playing opportunities for your characters. As they grapple with the truth behind the fanciful names, they may experience a mix of awe, disappointment, or even suspicion. They might also encounter NPCs who have formed their own beliefs and myths around these locations, adding further complexity to the narrative.

Remember, the beauty of Veridia lies not only in the fantastical, but also in the merging of the magical and the mundane. Embrace the opportunity to surprise and delight your players with hidden truths, and watch as they immerse themselves further into the rich tapestry of your post-apocalyptic world.

## The Forgotten

The Forgotten may be a diverse and vast group, here are a few examples of the types of individuals one might encounter among them:

1. **The Outcasts**: Among the Forgotten, some are individuals who were once part of the Civilised Tribes but were cast out or exiled due to their crimes, disobedience, or dissent. These Outcasts, filled with bitterness and a thirst for revenge, often form small bands or lone wolves, seeking to survive and, if possible, settle old scores with their former tribes.

2. **The Wasteland Nomads**: The Wasteland Nomads are a loosely organized group of wanderers who have chosen a life of solitude and freedom, refusing to be bound by the laws of any tribe. Skilled survivalists, they rely on their intimate knowledge of the wasteland and cunning to elude both monsters and rival factions. While some are peaceful, others resort to robbery and raiding to sustain their nomadic lifestyles.

3. **The Techno-Marauders**: These scavengers and tinkerers have embraced the remnants of the old world's technology. They roam the ruins in search of valuable relics and functioning gadgets to either trade or use for their own advantage. Armed with jury-rigged weapons and armor, the Techno-Marauders are resourceful, but their obsession with technology sometimes leads them to neglect other aspects of survival.

4. **The Cultists of the Abyss**: A mysterious and secretive group, the Cultists of the Abyss worship the cataclysmic event that brought about the apocalypse. They believe that the end of the old world was a necessary cleansing to pave the way for a new, dark era. Engaging in dark rituals and forbidden knowledge, they hope to hasten the arrival of their envisioned utopia. The Cultists are both feared and despised by other factions for their fanatical beliefs and unpredictable behavior.

5. **The Savage Mutants**: In the outskirts of Veridia, radiation and exposure to the apocalypse's aftermath have transformed some survivors into savage mutants. These abominations exhibit both human and monstrous traits and are often feared and misunderstood. While some mutants retain a semblance of humanity and desperately seek a cure, others have fully embraced their new form and become fierce predators, shunning any semblance of civilization.

6. **The Merciless Bandits**: A brutal and ruthless faction, the Merciless Bandits show no mercy to anyone who crosses their path. They raid settlements, ambush travelers, and extract "protection fees" from weaker factions. Led by cunning and charismatic leaders, they have managed to form a fearsome gang that strikes fear into the hearts of both Civilised Tribes and the Forgotten.

7. **The Mad Scribes**: This peculiar group is obsessed with recording and preserving the remnants of pre-apocalyptic knowledge. They are scavengers of books, ancient texts, and any form of forgotten knowledge. Hoarding their finds in hidden libraries, the Mad Scribes guard their knowledge jealously and may demand unusual prices for access to their archives.

The Forgotten are a mosaic of survival instincts, desperation, and unpredictability. Among them, there are those who merely try to survive another day, while others embrace their anarchic nature and revel in the chaos. As players venture into the world of Veridia, they will encounter this wild and diverse bunch, facing a myriad of challenges and moral dilemmas as they navigate the treacherous landscape of the Forgotten.
