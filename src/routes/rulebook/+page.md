## RULE BOOK

**Title: Wasteland Tales RPG**

**Civilised Tribes:**

1. In the world of Veridia, the remaining population has formed various civilised tribes, each centered around vital resources or strategic locations.
2. Players will belong to one of these civilised tribes, which provide support, protection, and a sense of community in the unforgiving wasteland.

**Character Creation:**

1. Each player starts by creating their character, including their name, background, and affiliation with one of the civilised tribes.
2. Characters have a set of attributes or traits (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Charisma) that define their capabilities.

**Game Mechanics:**

1. Use a standard deck of playing cards (including Jokers) as the randomizer. The suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) will represent different aspects of the character's actions.
2. At the start of the game, each player is dealt a hand of cards (4 cards per player). These cards represent the character's skills, strengths, and resources.
3. When a player attempts an action, they draw a card from their hand, add the relevant attribute or trait score, and compare it to the GM's set difficulty level.

**Resource Tokens and Hand Refresh:**

1. Each player starts with a limited number of Resource Tokens (start at 3 tokens per player). These tokens represent the character's resources and reserves.
2. To refresh their hand of cards, a player must expend one Resource Token. They discard any remaining cards in their hand and draw a new hand of cards (e.g., 4 cards) from the deck.
3. Players can choose when to spend their Resource Tokens strategically, refreshing their hand when they believe they need better cards for upcoming challenges.
4. If staying in a friendly/safe location with plenty of resources. A character refreshes half of charisma rounded down worth of resource tokens.
5. If a character has no hand left and either chooses not to refresh or cannot spend a refresh token, the fate of the character is based on a purely random flip for each action, no way to influence either way. Also watch for damage as reduction is not possible

**Combat System:**

1. When engaging in combat, the player and the GM each flip a card from the deck (the player can choose to spend a card from their hand to influence the outcome before flipping).
2. The values of the cards represent the attack strength. The higher value wins the combat exchange.
3. Players can spend a card from their hand to add its value to their combat strength, but they lose the card permanently from their hand.

**Damage and Health:**

1. When a character takes damage, the GM attack flip determines the severity of the injury (suits determine damage severity).
2. Players can spend a card from their hand to reduce the damage taken, absorbing the impact or dodging the attack.
3. the amount of damage you can sustain is equal to health level. Health is strength times 3
4. Once you reach 0 health you are down and out, only the gm knows what is the fate of your character.
   TODO! Work out character death and survival

**Leveling Up and Character Advancement:**

1. As players progress through the game, they earn experience points (XP) for completing quests, overcoming challenges, and contributing to the story. The GM awards XP based on character actions and achievements.
2. Players can spend XP points to gradually improve their character's attributes and skills, as described earlier.

**Equipment and Inventory:**

1. Characters can find or trade for various items, weapons, and gear during their adventures. These items provide narrative opportunities and bonuses in specific situations.
2. The inventory is represented narratively, and the focus is more on storytelling than tracking detailed inventories. Players can describe their character's equipment and how they use it creatively in the game.

## COMBAT

**Combat Turn Order and Initiative System:**

**Initiative Calculation:**

- At the beginning of combat, each player and the GM calculates their initiative score using the following formula:

  Initiative Score = Agility Attribute + Intelligence Attribute

**Initiative Order:**

- Arrange combatants in descending order based on their initiative scores. The character or NPC with the highest score goes first, followed by the one with the second-highest score, and so on. This order determines the sequence of actions during the combat encounter.

**Turn Actions:**

- Each player's turn consists of two actions, which can be a combination of Fast and Slow actions. Players have the freedom to choose how they use their two actions during their turn.
- Options are fast/fast or fast/slow

**Fast Actions:**

- Fast actions are quick and do not consume much time. Players can perform up to two Fast actions during their turn. Examples of Fast actions include:
  - Moving a short distance (e.g., taking cover, evading an attack).
  - Drawing a weapon, item, or interacting with the environment in a minor way (e.g., picking up an object, opening a door).

**Slow Actions:**

- Slow actions are more significant and may consume the entire turn. Players can perform one Slow action during their turn. Examples of Slow actions include:
  - Making a meaningful attack (e.g., using a weapon or supernatural power against an enemy).
  - Interacting with the environment in a major way (e.g., solving a puzzle, setting up a trap).
  - Driving a vehicle, hacking a computer system, administering first aid, or engaging in other complex tasks.

**Resolution and Combat Effects:**

- Each action's success or failure is determined using the card draw system, where players draw cards from their hands to overcome the set difficulty levels by the GM.
- Successful attacks deal damage based on weapon statistics and abilities. Players and NPCs may also apply combat effects, such as stunning, knocking back, or causing status ailments, depending on the situation and their powers.

**Next Round:**

- Once all combatants have taken their turns, the round ends. A new round begins with another initiative calculation for all combatants to determine the turn order for the next round. The combat continues until one side achieves their objectives or all threats are eliminated.

**Surprise Rounds:**

- If a combat encounter starts with one group having an advantage in surprise, the GM may allow the surprised party to forfeit their first turn or take other suitable measures to simulate the element of surprise.

**Combat System:**

1. When engaging in combat, the player and the GM each flip a card from the deck (the player can choose to spend a card from their hand to influence the outcome before flipping).
2. The values of the cards represent the attack strength. The higher value wins the combat exchange.
3. Players can spend a card from their hand to add its value to their combat strength, but they lose the card permanently from their hand.

## Combat

**Combat System:**

In Wasteland Tales RPG, the combat system revolves around a flip-off mechanic, where players and the GM flip cards to determine attack strength and resolve combat encounters. Here's how it works:

1. **Combat Initiation:**

   - When combat begins, each player and the GM prepares to flip a card from the deck. Players can decide whether to spend a card from their hand to influence the outcome before flipping. Spending a card from the hand adds its value to the combat strength but permanently removes the card from the player's hand.

2. **Card Flip-Off:**
   - The player and the GM simultaneously flip their respective cards, revealing their attack strength.

- The total for each player is calculated by adding combined card values to a skill which is then added to defining attribute.

3. **Determining the Winner:**

   - Compare the values of the flipped cards. The participant with the higher card value is the winner of the combat exchange.

4. **Inflicting Damage:**

   - The winner inflicts damage to the opponent based on the suit of the card they flipped:
     - **Hearts (♥):** The opponent takes a minor amount of damage.
     - **Diamonds (♦):** The opponent takes a moderate amount of damage.
     - **Clubs (♣):** The opponent takes a significant amount of damage.
     - **Spades (♠):** The opponent takes a major amount of damage.

5. **Joker Card:**

   - If a participant flips a Joker card, they automatically win the combat exchange. The Joker is a powerful card, signifying a decisive victory.

6. **Damage and Health:**

   - The amount of damage inflicted may vary based on the narrative context, the participants' capabilities, and the GM's judgment. Players can spend cards from their hand to reduce the damage they take, using their skills and resources to mitigate the impact of attacks.

7. **Combat Effects:**

   - In addition to damage, combat effects such as stunning, disarming, or knocking back opponents may occur during combat encounters, depending on the situation and the participants' powers and abilities.

8. **Combat Resolution:**
   - Combat continues with each participant taking turns to flip cards, inflict damage, and react to their opponents' actions until the encounter reaches a resolution.

## Damage Reduction

In Wasteland Tales RPG, players can spend cards from their hand to reduce the amount of damage their characters take during combat encounters. The damage reduction is based on the suit of the cards spent, with different suits providing varying degrees of protection.

**Damage Reduction Mechanism:**

1. **Damage Calculation:**

   - The GM calculates the amount of damage the character will suffer based on the situation, the opponent's attack strength, and any relevant modifiers.

2. **Player Decision:**

   - Before the GM narrates the damage received, the player has the opportunity to react by spending cards from their hand to reduce the damage. The player should state how their character attempts to evade, block, or mitigate the attack using their skills, abilities, or resources.

3. **Card Expenditure:**

   - The player selects one or more cards from their hand and reveals them to the GM. The suit of the cards spent determines the amount of damage reduction:

     - **Hearts (♥):** The opponent's attack is partially mitigated, and the character reduces a minor amount of damage.
     - **Diamonds (♦):** The character effectively defends against the attack, reducing a moderate amount of damage.
     - **Clubs (♣):** The character successfully blocks or evades the attack, reducing the damage a significant amount.
     - **Spades (♠):** The character skillfully parries or dodges the attack, resulting in a major reduction in damage.

4. **Narrative Description:**

   - The GM and player collaboratively narrate how the character avoids or lessens the impact of the attack, taking into account the suit of the cards spent. This could include descriptions of agile dodges, well-timed parries, the use of protective gear, or other creative methods of damage reduction.

5. **Card Loss:**

   - The cards spent by the player are permanently removed from their hand. This decision represents the character's exhaustion, depletion of resources, or mental strain as they react to the threat.

6. **Balancing Strategy:**

   - Players must carefully consider when to spend cards for damage reduction. Spending cards early in combat may leave them with fewer resources for later challenges. Conversely, saving cards for critical moments might expose them to more danger in the present.

7. **Resource Tokens:**
   - Players can also choose to spend Resource Tokens to refresh their hand of cards, potentially replenishing their options for damage reduction in subsequent rounds.
