## tribes

The cataclysmic event that caused the apocalypse forced humanity to seek safety and resources within the mega cities. However, as the cities collapsed and the world descended into chaos, the survivors were left to fend for themselves. Here are some reasons why tribes have formed:

**1. Resource Scarcity:** The apocalypse has devastated the once-thriving mega cities, leading to scarcity of essential resources like food, water, fuel, and medicine. Tribes have formed around key resource hubs, such as methane deposits, fertile farmlands, or clean water sources. By banding together, the tribes can better protect and manage these vital resources.

**2. Safety in Numbers:** The wasteland is dangerous, filled with monsters, husks, and other threats. Surviving alone is perilous, but by forming tribes, individuals gain safety in numbers. Together, they can defend against common enemies and watch out for one another, increasing their chances of survival.

**3. Division of Labor:** In a world with limited resources, cooperation and specialization become crucial. Tribes allow survivors to divide tasks based on skills and strengths. Some members might become skilled scavengers, while others excel in combat, farming, or crafting. The collective skills of the tribe ensure a more well-rounded and self-sufficient community.

**4. Cultural and Social Bonds:** Many tribes form around shared cultural or ideological bonds. They might have similar backgrounds, beliefs, or values, leading them to unite under a common identity. The tribe becomes a support network and a source of emotional connection amidst the harsh reality of the wasteland.

**5. Territorial Control:** As tribes establish themselves in various regions of the wasteland, territorial control becomes a means of survival. Tribes defend their territories against rival factions, ensuring exclusive access to resources and protection from hostile forces.

**6. Leadership and Governance:** The tribes establish systems of leadership and governance to maintain order and resolve disputes. These structures provide stability and direction in a chaotic world, making decisions on resource distribution, conflict resolution, and community rules.

**7. Resistance Against the Forgotten:** The forgotten, the ruthless and evil survivors, pose a significant threat to the civilised tribes. Forming alliances and tribes allows the civilised to unite against these dangerous adversaries and protect themselves from their malevolent actions.

**8. Historical Ties:** Some tribes might have historical ties that predate the apocalypse. They could be remnants of pre-apocalyptic organizations, families, or communities that managed to survive and adapt to the new world.

Among the many tribes that now inhabit Veridia, several prominent ones stand out, each known for their distinct characteristics and territorial holdings:

1. **The Evergreen Enclave**: Nestled within the ruins of a once-thriving park, The Evergreen Enclave has become an oasis of green amidst the desolation. Their territory is abundant with flora and fauna, and the tribe reveres nature, considering themselves its custodians. They are skilled herbalists, using their knowledge of plants for healing, sustenance, and crafting potent brews. Breaking their laws means defiling the sanctity of nature, a crime that they punish severely.

2. **The Crimson Caravan**: This nomadic tribe has transformed a fleet of abandoned cargo trucks into a mobile fortress. The Crimson Caravan roams the wasteland, trading goods and information with other tribes. They value resourcefulness, adaptability, and loyalty above all else. However, they also fiercely guard their secrets, and anyone caught stealing from or betraying them will face swift retribution.

3. **The Luminous Lodge**: In the heart of the shattered cityscape, The Luminous Lodge has taken refuge in the remains of a grand cathedral, now adorned with salvaged lights and candles. This tribe worships light as a symbol of hope and renewal in the darkness. They are skilled tinkerers, using the remnants of technology to create various devices. Intruders who disrupt their sacred rituals or tamper with their fragile light installations risk being branded as bringers of darkness and banished.

4. **The Iron Fist Syndicate**: Residing in an imposing factory complex, The Iron Fist Syndicate thrives on manufacturing weapons, armor, and other essential resources. They believe that strength and order are crucial for survival, and their laws are strict and inflexible. Criminals often face harsh punishments, and the Syndicate is known for its efficient yet ruthless enforcers.

5. **The Soaring Skystead**: This tribe has made their home atop a series of interconnected skyscrapers. Skilled engineers and inventors, The Soaring Skystead is known for their aeronautical innovations. They have restored a few aircraft, using them for reconnaissance and occasionally trading with distant tribes. They highly value intellect and innovation, but outsiders who threaten their precarious structures face the danger of being cast down to the streets below.

These tribes are just a few examples of the diverse and dynamic factions that inhabit Veridia. Each tribe has its own rich history, unique traditions, and approach to survival. As players venture through the post-apocalyptic landscape, they will encounter these tribes and their laws, navigating the delicate balance between cooperation and conflict in the pursuit of a better future.

## Creating a Civilised Tribe

Step by Step:

1. **Conceptualisation:** Decide on the concept and theme for your tribe. Consider the tribe's beliefs, values, and purpose in the wasteland. Are they focused on survival, trade, knowledge, or something else?
2. **Resource and Territory:** Choose a vital resource that sustains your tribe and dictates their territorial holdings. This resource should be scarce and valuable in the wasteland, driving the tribe's survival and conflicts.
3. **Location:** Determine the tribe's base of operations and territory within Veridia. It could be an abandoned building, a natural landmark, or a makeshift fortification.
4. **Leadership and Governance:** Define the tribe's leadership structure. This could be a single leader, a council of elders, or a system of democracy. Consider how decisions are made, and how disputes are resolved.
5. **Laws and Customs:** Create a set of laws and customs that govern the tribe. These should reflect the tribe's values and priorities, and outline the consequences for breaking these laws.
6. **Skills and Specialisations:** Consider the tribe's skills and specialisations. What are they good at? Are they skilled in combat, crafting, trading, farming, or something else?
7. **Alliances and Rivals:** Determine the tribe's relationships with other tribes in Veridia. Are they part of an alliance or in conflict with certain factions? How do they interact with neighbouring tribes?
8. **Culture and Traditions:** Develop the tribe's culture and traditions. This includes their rituals, ceremonies, and beliefs that have emerged in the wasteland.
9. **Appearance and Symbols:** Create symbols and visual cues that represent the tribe. This could be a unique emblem, specific clothing styles, or other visual markers that set them apart.
10. **Notable NPCs:** Flesh out a few notable NPCs within the tribe. These could be key leaders, skilled warriors, or revered elders that players might encounter.
11. **Conflict and Goals:** Define the tribe's primary conflict and goals in the wasteland. What are they trying to achieve, and what obstacles stand in their way?
12. **History and Backstory:** Craft a history and backstory for the tribe, detailing their origins and how they survived the apocalypse. This adds depth to the tribe's narrative.

By following these steps, you can create a rich and engaging civilised tribe that fits seamlessly into the post-apocalyptic world of Veridia. Each tribe should have its own unique identity and purpose, adding depth and intrigue to the players' adventures as they navigate the diverse landscape of the wasteland.
