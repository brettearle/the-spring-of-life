## Example Session 0

As the sun sets on the wasteland horizon, three brave players and the GM gather around the flickering campfire. Each player describes the tribe they hail from and the resource that sustains them in this harsh world:

**1. Player 1:** Tribe: The Whispering Winds Resource: Ancient knowledge and artifacts Character: "Sage," a wandering scholar who seeks to preserve and decipher the remnants of old world knowledge. Sage joined The Whispering Winds after finding an ancient tome that hinted at the tribe's potential to reshape the future.

**2. Player 2:** Tribe: The Ironclad Defenders Resource: Scrap metal and advanced technology Character: "Rivet," a skilled mechanic and scavenger with an unparalleled talent for repairing advanced tech. Rivet's attachment to The Ironclad Defenders stems from their childhood friend, Thorn, who sought their expertise to fix a vital defense system.

**3. Player 3:** Tribe: The Verdant Guardians Resource: Lush oasis and fertile soil Character: "Thorn," a resourceful hunter and tracker who navigates the treacherous Inbetween Lands to secure food for the tribe. Thorn's deep bond with Sage formed during a dangerous expedition to find rare herbs that could heal the ailing Silent Song.

**Important Question: Why Are They Together?** While each player's character belongs to different tribes, fate has intertwined their destinies. A mysterious message from a forgotten civilization has reached all three tribes, promising a powerful artifact hidden deep within the Inbetween Lands. Realizing that none of their tribes can risk facing the dangers alone, Sage, Rivet, and Thorn forge an uneasy alliance to seek the artifact and ensure their tribes' survival.

As the players share their backgrounds, a sense of wariness hangs in the air. While they've formed an alliance, each character knows that the wasteland breeds a ruthless survival instinct. In the desolate landscape of the Inbetween Lands, trust can be a fleeting luxury, and cooperation often comes at a price. They venture forward, their steps heavy with the burden of their tribes' expectations and their own secrets.

The GM, acting as a guide and storyteller, observes the players' interactions, knowing that not all intentions are pure. As the journey unfolds, they'll face tests that challenge their allegiance, confront their darkest desires, and question the morality of their actions. The wasteland is unforgiving, and the heroes must navigate treacherous paths, where alliances are fragile, and betrayals can shatter the very foundations of trust.

Together, they trudge through the unforgiving wasteland, a tenuous alliance bound by ambition and the pursuit of power. The path ahead is uncertain, but the desire for survival and the allure of the artifact drive them forward. As the heroes face the grim reality of Veridia, they must grapple with their own shadows, wondering if their alliances will endure or if the darkness of the wasteland will consume them all.

## The Armoury

In the post-apocalyptic world of Veridia, where melee weapons are prevalent and ballistic weapons are scarce, survival and resourcefulness are essential for the inhabitants. Here are some equipment items commonly found among the wasteland's survivors:

1. **Scrap Armor**: Crafted from salvaged metal, leather, and other materials, scrap armor provides basic protection against attacks. It's often cobbled together from various sources, making each set unique in appearance. While not as effective as pre-apocalyptic armor, it offers crucial defense against the claws, fangs, and crude weapons of both monsters and hostile factions.

2. **Rustic Shields**: Shields made from reclaimed materials such as wood, metal scraps, and salvaged plastic offer an additional layer of protection for those venturing into the dangerous unknown. Although they may not withstand heavy ballistic fire, these shields are effective against melee attacks and provide a sense of security in close combat.

3. **Mechanical Gadgets**: The wasteland is home to a variety of jury-rigged mechanical gadgets crafted by the Techno-Marauders and other mechanically inclined survivors. These include wrist-mounted grappling hooks for scaling ruins, improvised traps, and modified tools for various purposes.

4. **Toxicity Filter Masks**: Essential in areas plagued by toxic fumes and radiation, toxicity filter masks protect against harmful airborne particles. Cobbled together from gas masks and improvised filters, these masks are vital for exploration in hazardous environments.

5. **Molotov Cocktails**: A makeshift incendiary weapon, Molotov cocktails consist of glass bottles filled with flammable liquids such as alcohol or gasoline. Survivors use them as both offensive tools and makeshift distractions against aggressive foes.

6. **Veridian Survival Packs**: Distributed by the Civilised Tribes, these packs contain basic necessities for survival, including purified water, preserved food, bandages, and basic tools. They are often traded for valuable resources or offered as part of diplomatic agreements between tribes.

7. **Huskbane Salves**: Alchemists and herbalists among the Civilised Tribes concoct Huskbane Salves to temporarily deter Husks. When applied to weapons or armor, these salves emit a pungent odor that can ward off the undead, providing a brief respite from their relentless pursuit.

8. **Whisperblades**: Silent and deadly, whisperblades are specialized knives with a serrated edge designed to minimize noise while inflicting lethal cuts. They are favored by scouts, assassins, and those who prefer stealthy approaches.

9. **Survivor's Journals**: In the wasteland, knowledge is a valuable currency. Survivor's Journals, filled with valuable information on the best routes, safe havens, and potential threats, are highly sought after. They are often found on the remains of explorers or scavengers.

10. **Distress Flares**: Signal flares are crucial for attracting attention or calling for help in dangerous situations. Survivors use them as a last resort when under attack or when seeking aid from nearby tribes.

In the barren and dangerous world of Veridia, these items serve as lifelines for the inhabitants, enabling them to endure the trials of the wasteland and forge their paths in the face of uncertainty and peril. The scarcity of ballistic weapons encourages creativity and adaptability, as survivors learn to rely on their skills, wits, and makeshift equipment to survive each day.

## The Bestiary

**The Husks:**
The Husks are the ghastly remnants of humanity, cursed to roam the wastelands of Veridia after the forgotten apocalypse. Once living beings, they have been transformed into mindless, decaying abominations driven by an insatiable hunger for flesh. The cause of their transformation remains shrouded in mystery, but many believe it is a result of exposure to a potent and ancient curse unleashed during the apocalypse.

Husks are a varied lot, reflecting the diverse range of individuals that once comprised humanity. Some are slow and lumbering, while others are surprisingly fast and agile. Their appearances are equally diverse, with twisted and grotesque features often resulting from the grotesque effects of the curse. The Husks pose a constant threat to both the Civilised Tribes and the Forgotten, forcing survivors to be ever-vigilant in their attempts to avoid the monsters' ravenous appetites.

1. **The Gloomreaver**: This ominous and formidable creature is a living embodiment of darkness and despair. Towering over its victims, the Gloomreaver has shadowy tendrils that ensnare prey, drawing them into the shadows where they are devoured. It is said that the Gloomreaver is a manifestation of the anguish and sorrow that lingers in the hearts of the survivors.

2. **The Rust Wraiths**: Formed from the souls of those who met their demise due to the decay of technology and industry, the Rust Wraiths are haunting spirits encased in rusted metal husks. They emit eerie, mechanical noises, and their touch causes corrosion and decay. Legends tell of Rust Wraiths stalking those who dare to disturb the remnants of the old world.

3. **The Biomorph Swarm**: A horrifying amalgamation of flesh and insect-like features, the Biomorph Swarm is a relentless horde of monstrous creatures. These nightmarish beings are a result of unnatural experimentation gone awry during the forgotten era. The swarm moves as a singular entity, devouring all living beings in its path, leaving behind only devastation.

4. **The Ephemeral Sirens**: Beautiful and alluring, the Ephemeral Sirens are spectral beings that haunt the ruins of Veridia's once-grand theaters and opera houses. They use their mesmerizing songs to lure unsuspecting travelers into their clutches, where they drain the life force from their victims, leaving them as lifeless husks.

5. **The Leviathan of the Depths**: A monstrous aquatic creature that emerged from the depths of Veridia's toxic seas, the Leviathan is a colossal aberration. Its massive, hulking form is covered in mutated barnacles and bio-luminescent patterns that light up the murky waters. The Leviathan is both feared and revered by some Forgotten tribes as a symbol of the apocalypse's power.

6. **The Scytheraptors**: These monstrous creatures are a horrifying combination of predatory birds and reptiles. Mutated by the lingering effects of radiation, they possess razor-sharp talons and serrated beaks, making them deadly hunters. Scytheraptors are highly territorial and are known to nest in high places, launching swift and deadly attacks on unsuspecting prey.

7. **The Graveworms**: These gigantic, burrowing creatures are mutations of earthworms and other subterranean species. With thick, armored hides and rows of gnashing teeth, they tunnel beneath the surface, creating unstable grounds in the wasteland. Graveworms pose a threat to both the Civilised Tribes' settlements and the Forgotten's hiding spots, as they undermine structures and create sinkholes.

8. **The Nightshade Stalkers**: Once common domestic cats, these animals were affected by a toxic substance that transformed them into cunning and elusive predators. Nightshade Stalkers are masters of stealth and ambush, using the shadows to their advantage. Their venomous claws and fangs paralyze their prey, leaving them defenseless against the Stalkers' swift and deadly strikes.

9. **The Stormwing Bats**: Mutated bats with an impressive wingspan and increased strength, Stormwing Bats have developed a unique ability to control the wind currents around them. They use this power to swoop down on their prey, disorienting them with powerful gusts before delivering deadly strikes with their fangs.

10. **The Omega Wolves**: These ferocious, larger-than-life wolves were once apex predators. Now, they are even more deadly due to radiation-induced mutations. The Omega Wolves are pack hunters, known for their intelligence, teamwork, and uncanny ability to ambush and surround their prey.

These mutated creatures add another layer of danger and diversity to the post-apocalyptic world of Veridia. As the players venture through the wasteland, they will face an array of mutated fauna alongside the husks and other monstrous entities, making their journey through this unforgiving landscape even more challenging and unpredictable.

These creatures, along with the Husks, roam the desolate cityscape of Veridia, presenting constant challenges and threats to the survival of the Civilised Tribes and the Forgotten. Players will encounter these monstrous beings as they navigate the wasteland, requiring wit, courage, and resourcefulness to stand against the horrors of this post-apocalyptic world.
