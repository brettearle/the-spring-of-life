## The World

The Spring of life, also known as "Veridia," is festering with life after the rebirth of the world. The city was once a megalopolis of a great before times, a thriving hub of human civilization. Now, it lies in ruins, a haunting reminder of a bygone era. The streets are littered with debris, and once-proud buildings now stand as shattered remnants of their former glory.

The world as it was known has been devastated, and in its wake, monstrous creatures and mindless husks of humanity roam freely. These husks are the wretched remnants of what were once people, driven solely by their insatiable hunger for the flesh of the civilized or the forgotten.

In the aftermath of the apocalypse, the survivors have formed loose alliances to increase their chances of survival. They are divided into two main groups - the Civilized and the Forgotten. The Civilized are those who have managed to organize themselves into tribes or communities centered around critical resources such as methane, food, or even booze. These tribes have established their own laws and governance systems, maintaining some semblance of order and civilization amidst the chaos.

On the other hand, the Forgotten are the remaining survivors who have resorted to whatever means necessary to stay alive. They are a diverse group, ranging from opportunistic scavengers to ruthless raiders, willing to do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means committing heinous acts.

As part of this tabletop RPG, the players will assume the roles of members of the loose alliance of the Civilized. They will navigate the treacherous and perilous landscape of Veridia, facing dangerous monsters, hostile factions, and the constant struggle for resources. Survival and cooperation will be key as they strive to maintain some semblance of humanity in this brutal and unforgiving post-apocalyptic world. Along their journey, they will have the opportunity to shape the destiny of Veridia and determine what kind of world may rise from the ashes.

## The Civilised

In the desolate remnants of Veridia, the surviving humans have formed loose alliances known as the Civilised Tribes. Each tribe has managed to carve out its own territory, centered around vital resources, and has developed its own unique laws and customs to govern its people. Despite their differences, these tribes understand the necessity of cooperation for survival and have established a system of trade and mutual respect for one another's laws.

## Stories of The World

### Kaela, The Elder

In the dimly lit chamber of the tribal council, the air was thick with tension and secrets. As the elders of the Civilised Tribes gathered for the crucial meeting, alliances were formed and shattered in whispers behind closed doors. The flickering flames of torches cast ominous shadows on the faces of the council members, concealing their true intentions.

Kaela, the wise and respected elder of The Evergreen Enclave, called for order, her gaze sweeping across the room. Unbeknownst to the others, she had received a mysterious message just before the meeting, hinting at a potential betrayal from within the council itself. Her instincts told her to be cautious, but she needed more information before she could act.

As the council deliberated on the looming threat of the colossal creature, Lady Amara of The Luminous Lodge seemed to be pushing for a swift and aggressive response. Her eyes glinted with a steely determination that made some elders uneasy. Torgen, the leader of The Iron Fist Syndicate, exchanged knowing glances with Harrik of The Crimson Caravan, sensing an ulterior motive behind Lady Amara's eagerness.

During a brief recess, Kaela discreetly sought out information from her most trusted advisors. She discovered that Lady Amara had secretly dispatched scouts to a hidden location known as the "Crystal Nexus," a site rumored to hold immense power. Kaela's suspicions grew, and she knew she had to act quickly.

As the council reconvened, Kaela chose her words carefully, advocating for a cautious approach. She proposed gathering more intelligence on the creature and understanding its origins before launching a full-scale attack. But Lady Amara was unyielding in her determination, insisting on the immediate mobilization of their combined forces.

In a cunning move, Kaela suggested a vote to decide the course of action. She hoped to buy enough time to investigate Lady Amara's hidden agenda and protect her tribe from potential harm. The council agreed to a vote, and each elder cast their decision.

The results were split, with Harrik and Torgen supporting Kaela's approach, while Lady Amara and a few others favored an immediate offensive. The decision was left to the council's youngest member, Neela, whose tribe had a reputation for their impartiality and neutrality. Neela's vote would decide the fate of the tribes.

As the weight of the decision settled on Neela's shoulders, she hesitated, torn between the two factions. Unknown to the others, Lady Amara had secretly approached Neela before the meeting, offering her tribe the secrets of the Crystal Nexus in exchange for her loyalty. The young elder knew that her choice could potentially lead to disaster or prosperity for her people.

In a moment of courage, Neela made her decision, breaking the deadlock in favor of Lady Amara's aggressive approach. The tension in the room skyrocketed, and Kaela's heart sank as she realized the extent of the betrayal. The council erupted into heated arguments, accusations, and distrust.

In the ensuing chaos, Kaela discreetly slipped away to uncover the truth about the Crystal Nexus. She knew she couldn't trust anyone but her most loyal companions. Together, they ventured into the depths of the wasteland, seeking answers and evidence of Lady Amara's true intentions.

As the dust settled on the council's political battlefield, alliances had crumbled, and bitter rivalries emerged. The council was fractured, with some tribes vowing never to trust the others again. The looming threat of the colossal creature remained, but the tribes were now divided, and cooperation seemed impossible.

Kaela's investigation revealed the extent of Lady Amara's treachery. The Crystal Nexus held a source of unimaginable power, and Lady Amara sought to harness it for herself, caring little for the welfare of the other tribes. Armed with the evidence, Kaela confronted Lady Amara, exposing her deception before the remaining council members.

The council was once again faced with a decision - to unite against the colossal creature or succumb to the treacherous whispers of power and ambition. In the face of betrayal, the elders realized that survival depended on trust, cooperation, and unity. They put their differences aside and joined forces, standing against the colossal creature and the real threat within their midst.

However, the wounds of betrayal ran deep, and the political tension among the tribes remained palpable. While they faced the external threat as a united front, the internal divisions lingered, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the council. Each elder now guarded their secrets even more closely, unsure whom to trust.

In the weeks that followed, the council's delicate balance of power became even more precarious. Each tribe focused on protecting its interests and resources, watching the others with suspicion. The once vibrant spirit of cooperation was replaced by a cautious and uneasy truce.

As the council convened for future meetings, the air crackled with tension. Words were measured, and alliances shifted subtly in the shadows. The council was a powder keg of conflicting ambitions, and every decision weighed heavily on the fate of Veridia.

In the midst of this political turmoil, the colossal creature continued to loom on the horizon, a constant reminder of the greater threat that could engulf them all. The tribes knew they must stand united to survive, yet the specter of betrayal haunted them, making every step forward a treacherous path to navigate.

The political meeting of tribal elders had changed the dynamics of Veridia forever. The decisions made that day would reverberate through the wasteland, shaping the future of the tribes and their struggle for survival. In this unforgiving world, where alliances were forged and shattered as quickly as the shifting sands, the true test of leadership and diplomacy had just begun. The fate of Veridia hung in the balance, uncertain and precarious, as the tribes grappled with their shared destiny amidst the ever-present shadows of betrayal and backstabbing.

### Emery, The Duskborne Scavenger

The sun was a distant memory, shrouded behind the thick, suffocating clouds of the post-apocalyptic world. I trudged through the debris-laden streets of Veridia, my feet crunching on broken glass and discarded remnants of the past. My tribe, the Dustborne, survived on the scarce remnants of a world now forgotten.

I wore a tattered cloak, a relic from the world before. It was a sign of my people, a mark of our resilience in the face of darkness. The Dustborne, a tribe bound by necessity, scattered across the remnants of the once great megalopolis. We were a loose alliance, our tribes respecting each other's laws but driven by the thirst for survival.

My name is Emery, and I was a scavenger. My task was to venture into the Inbetween, that desolate space between our territories, where the shadows danced and nightmares lurked. It was a treacherous journey, but one that kept our tribes alive. I carried a rusted blade and a few bullets for my pistol, a rare find amidst the ruins.

One evening, as the sun dimmed behind the horizon, I set out on my journey once more. The night swallowed me whole, and the city whispered its haunting tales. As I navigated the crumbling remains of buildings, a cold wind stirred the dust, and I sensed a presence lingering in the dark.

I came upon a group of Wanderers, a faction of the Forgotten, their eyes vacant and souls hollowed by the wasteland's embrace. They had strayed into our territory, driven by their greed and thirst for power. I hid in the shadows, observing them from afar.

They were ruthless and cunning, preying on the weak and defenseless. I knew I had to act, for their malevolence would only lead to more suffering. I reached into my cloak, feeling the weight of the cards in my hand. The cards, a reminder of the games we played before the world changed.

With a flick of my wrist, I unleashed my first power, an ability to manipulate the shadows themselves. The darkness coiled around me, an extension of my will. I moved unseen, like a phantom in the night, my steps soundless, my presence concealed.

One by one, I struck. The shadows danced, wrapping themselves around the Wanderers. Fear crept into their eyes as they realized they were not alone. They fired their weapons blindly, the shots echoing through the ruined city. I weaved through the chaos, my powers guiding my path.

The tide turned, and the Wanderers fell, their bodies limp and lifeless. I stood amidst the fallen, my heart heavy with the weight of my actions. In this world of desolation, I had become an avenger, a harbinger of justice in the midst of chaos.

As the sun timidly rose, casting a faint glow over the city, I returned to my tribe. My fellow Dustborne welcomed me with nods of understanding, for they knew the price we paid to survive. In the wasteland, we were the heroes and the villains, bound by the choices we made and the powers we possessed.

And so, the tale of Emery, the Dustborne scavenger, echoed through the streets of Veridia. A story of shadows and survival, where the lines between hero and villain blurred, and the wasteland revealed the true strength of the human spirit.

### Eldric, The Deep Delver

In the depths of Veridia's wasteland, where the surface had long been devoured by the apocalypse, I found solace in the labyrinth of old underground passages. My name is Eldric, a mushroom delver, and my tribe was known as the Luminescent Wanderers. We were drawn to the subterranean realm by the soft glow of bioluminescent fungi, the only light that pierced the darkness.

As I descended into the depths, my lantern illuminated the ancient stone walls. The air was thick with a musty scent, a reminder of the world that once thrived above. My heart raced with excitement and trepidation, for every expedition into the old passages was an adventure into the unknown.

The Luminescent Wanderers believed that the mushrooms held secrets – whispers of forgotten times and remnants of knowledge that could reshape our fractured world. Armed with a satchel and a pickaxe, I delved into the darkness, guided by the radiant mushrooms that sprouted along the walls.

The passages were a maze, winding and interconnected like the veins of a living creature. I followed the luminescent trail, my fingers grazing the cool stone, as I ventured deeper into the abyss. There was a sense of tranquility in the silence, a stark contrast to the chaos above.

With each step, the bioluminescent fungi grew more vibrant, casting an ethereal glow that painted the walls in shades of azure and emerald. The Luminescent Wanderers believed that the mushrooms were guardians of ancient knowledge, preserving secrets long forgotten.

As I progressed, I discovered a chamber adorned with glowing mushrooms of a unique hue – a luminous crimson. My heart quickened with anticipation, for this was a rare sight even for us. I approached cautiously, marveling at the beauty that surrounded me.

In the center of the chamber, an ancient stone pedestal stood, upon which rested a small, weathered tome. Its pages were delicate and brittle, but the writing within was unlike any I had seen before. The script seemed to dance with a silvery luminescence, as if telling stories of a bygone era.

The Luminescent Wanderers believed that such tomes were the keys to unlocking the mysteries of our world's past. With great care, I tucked the book into my satchel, its secrets now entrusted to me.

As I prepared to leave, a faint tremor shook the chamber. The ancient stones shifted, and I felt the presence of something ancient and powerful. The air hummed with energy, and the mushrooms seemed to sing a somber song.

In that moment, I realized that the underground passages held more than just forgotten knowledge; they held the essence of a world that once was. My heart swelled with a mixture of awe and sorrow as I made my way back to the surface.

Emerging into the wasteland's desolation, I clutched the tome tightly, knowing that it held the stories of those who came before. The Luminescent Wanderers would celebrate this discovery, for it was a testament to our purpose – to shed light on the forgotten, to preserve the wisdom of a world that now dwelled in shadows.

And so, with each journey into the underground passages, we ventured closer to the truth, guided by the luminescence that lingered beneath the surface. In the wasteland's darkness, we were the beacons of knowledge, illuminating the path to a future shaped by the past.

### Seraphina, The Wasteland Knight

In the heart of Veridia's desolate city, where shadows lurked with malevolence and ruins whispered of forgotten horrors, I found myself as a Wasteland Knight. My name is Seraphina, a lone survivor in this apocalyptic wasteland, destined to protect a vital trade caravan that journeyed between the tribes of Sandriders and the Oasis Enclave.

The caravan's cargo was not just a lifeline; it was a last flicker of hope in the wasteland's abyss, carrying precious resources, medicines, and technology to sustain the dwindling tribes. As the guardian of this lifeline, I rode atop my makeshift motorcycle, a relic of the past world, my armor bearing the scars of countless battles.

The Sandriders, with their nomadic resilience, were adept at navigating the twisted streets and broken alleyways of the ruined city. The Oasis Enclave, a sanctuary hidden amidst the rubble, offered solace to the desperate and weary. Both tribes relied on the trade caravan, for it held the glimmers of a future beyond despair.

As the caravan ventured into the heart of the city, a sense of foreboding clung to the air. Unseen eyes watched from the shadows, and an unsettling silence prevailed. I led the way, my car door shield and heavy chain mace at the ready, prepared for any threat that dared cross our path.

The marauders of the Desolation Reavers emerged from the darkness, a vicious pack lusting for the caravan's cargo. With malicious intent, they unleashed chaos upon us, overwhelming the caravan's defenders. My chain mace struck with fury, yet the battle was fierce, and I could not save them all.

In the midst of the skirmish, an unearthly howl echoed through the ruins, freezing our blood. From the depths of the wasteland, an abomination emerged – a mutant monster, grotesque and immense, with eyes that glowed like dying embers. Husks, the mindless remnants of humanity, followed the monstrous creature like shadows of doom.

The Desolation Reavers and the caravan's defenders stood united, their conflict forgotten as the mutant beast turned its wrath upon all. Chaos reigned, and the caravan was engulfed in destruction. I fought with all my might, but I could only save a few, whisking them away from the carnage.

As the caravan burned, the mutant monster, driven by its primal thirst for annihilation, slaughtered all in its path. I could only watch in anguish as the fragile hopes of the tribes were devoured in the jaws of despair.

Amidst the ruin, I glimpsed the precious hidden cargo – a last glimmer of hope that still remained. It was all that mattered now. With grim determination, I shielded the cargo and those I had managed to save, vowing to carry their hope forward, even as darkness engulfed us.

In the aftermath, the city was swallowed by an eternal night, and the echoes of loss haunted me. The tribes would mourn their fallen, and the ashes of the caravan would be forgotten, but I, Seraphina, would carry the weight of this tragedy in my heart.

I rode into the desolate horizon, burdened by the knowledge that the wasteland's malevolence could never be quelled. Yet, amidst the embers of ruin, I still clung to hope – hope that the hidden cargo could kindle a spark of redemption, hope that someday, amidst the darkness, a new dawn would rise in Veridia's unforgiving wasteland.
